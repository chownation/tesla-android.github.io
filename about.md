### About

We all know that Tesla vehicles are not designed to support Android, CarPlay or Android Auto. This project changes that by turning the browser into an interactive Android tablet that works when the vehicle is being driven. 

After six months of work first alpha version has been released. The main objective for this release has been simple: usability. For the project to scale and become popular in the Tesla community it needs to provide a responsive Android experience. Otherwise, people won't use it. In June 2022 a second release (version 2022.25.1) was published. 

Right now the focus is starting to shift towards better integration and simplification. Dropping the two boards requirement will help in reducing both cost and entry barrier by reducing the install guide to something that can be done in a matter of minutes.
